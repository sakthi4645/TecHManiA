                    <h2>30000mAh Mi Power Bank 3 Quick Charge Edition With 18W Charging, 24W Input Launched</h2>
                    <p>
                        Xiaomi has launched a 30000mAh Mi Power Bank 3 Quick Charge Edition. The new model comes with the ability to charge up to three devices at once, along with 18W fast charging support via a USB Type-C port. Xiaomi has also provided a low-current mode that works specifically for charging devices that require low power, such as smart wristbands and Bluetooth wireless earbuds. The 30000mAh Mi Power Bank 3 Quick Charge Edition includes USB Type-C 24W Max high-power input support that brings a fast charging experience.

30000mAh Mi Power Bank 3 Quick Charge Edition price, availability details
The 30000mAh Mi Power Bank 3 Quick Charge price has been set at CNY 169 (roughly Rs. 1,800). The power bank is initially available for pre-bookings in China through JD.com and Xiaomi's Mi.com, with its availability scheduled for June 18. Details about the global launch of the 30000mAh Mi Power Bank 3 Quick Charge Edition are yet to be revealed.

30000mAh Mi Power Bank 3 Quick Charge Edition specifications, features
Xiaomi has designed the 30000mAh Mi Power Bank 3 Quick Charge Edition with the ability to charge phones for over 10 times. The company claims that the new power bank can charge a Mi 10 or Redmi K30 Pro 4.5 times, while an iPhone SE (2020) can be charged for 10.5 times. All this is significantly more than what you'll get on a previous generation Mi Power Bank. Further, the new model has 18W fast charging support via its USB Type-C port. This allows users to charge an iPhone 11 in just 1.45 hours, 54 percent faster charging time than what one can get from the traditional 5W travel charger.
